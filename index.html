    <h2>Assignment 4.5</h2>
    <h3>Strings and Conditionals</h3>
    <p> The string method .concat() can be used to add string variables together, 
        kind of like how compound words are made. Compound words are 
        made from combining two different words. </p>
        <p id= "word1"></p>
        + <br>
        <p id= "word2"></p>
        = <br>
    </p>
    <p id ="compoundWord" onclick="addWords()">Click here for compound word</p>
    <p> other string methods can change the text <br>
    .toUpperCase (  ) = </p>
    <p id ="upperCase" onclick="upperCase()">Click here for upper case</p>
    .toLowerCase (  ) = </p>
    <p id ="lowerCase" onclick="lowerCase()">Click here for lower case</p>
    
    <p>Use of the .concat can be especially useful when you want to write html code
        from a javascript file. Let's say you wanted to make a calendar or a clock. You 
        could write some html in js so that it updates automatically.
    </p>
    <p id= "today">Today is today.</p>
    <p id= "time"></p>
    <p id= "numberDay">If today was a number it would be numberDay. <br>
    But I don't know why anyone would want to convert a date to a number.</p>
    <p id= "writeAllValues"></p>
